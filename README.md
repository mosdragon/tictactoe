<h3>C++ Tic-Tac-Toe game</h3>

I created this game actually following an online tutorial over the Winter Break during December 2013 when I was venturing a bit with C++. The game is pretty easily to follow along. A user just has to enter a vacant spot on the Tic-Tac-Toe board and that spot becomes their play. When someone connects three spaces in a row, he or she is declared the winner and the game prompts you to play again.
